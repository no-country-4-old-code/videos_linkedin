## Folder
- videos/ : contain all videos.
- ideas_raw/ : contain ideas. No folder for you.
- status.md : contain status of videos.

## Purpose
This repository contains scripts for videos about coding and security.
The videos are rather short (max. 5 min) and information dense.
See text of existing one for example.
The video need to be enteraining, so I want to show short exciting things.
The video is normally as follows:
- Entry with me in fullscreen. I say 1-2 sentence to hook people.
- Then we the the screenrecording, whcih is CLI , Coding, Repositories, whatever. I speak , but nobody sees me.
- Then at the end , we change to fullscreen again, and I finsih the recording and set a hook for next time.

## Expectation towards Claude
Scripts according to my style.
Code / CLI / BASH Examples that work and are catchy.
Claude does never any git commands.

## Workflow
Look into status.md. You work on the following status:
- [ ] : Create a folder and a short description what you think that video could be about. 
- [s] : Based on the description, you find in the folder of this video, you create a script.md. Start with a script.md which has "Code / CLI / Actions" and "Text / Speech" together. Set status on [o] afterwards. Make sure this text matches the generell text style and the purpose of the repo.
- [o] : Ignore those videos
- [c] : Rework this video-description according to Review-Findings. Result should be a status.md where "Code / CLI " (all screen actions) and "Text / Speech" be under seperate headlines. This makes it easier to record one video for screen actions seperatly later on. Set status on [o] afterwards.
- [r] : Ignore those videos
- [x] : Ignore those videos
- [yyyy.mm.dd] : Ignore those videos
