--- 07_Rust_bloated
--- 08_ASLR
--- 09_PIE Vs No PIE
--- 10__data Vs. .bss Vs .ro
--- DOOM 1 run GitHub. Bad: Losing health. Many ways to modify. PRELOAD-Technique .so -> Build lib with otign files, then PRELoad and intercept.
--- Shared Lib Injection DURING FLIGHT in RAM (Program with uses func of .so to print number all sec. . Attach via gdb. Load own .so with other print func in memory same ABI (dlopen). Then modify pointer from relocation table, so that now this is called. Deattach gdb.
--- Mixing Rust and C / C++ and ASM 
--- Rust in Linux 
--- Hack1: Shell-Code Injection (NX-protect)
--- Hack2: Put in ENV && overwrite IP (Canary, NX-protect)
--- Hack3: ROL Attack - jumping from to from (ASLR)
--- Hack4: Sidechannel attack (Meltdown, How displayed)
--- HackMe 1 & 2
--- CPU - Pipeline faster with sorted (e.g. of CPU pipeline)
--- CPU - Caches 
--- CPU - ??? Max. nr of arguments ?
--- CPU - vulnerbilities (sys/cpu/vulnerbilitues)
--- CPU vs. GPU
--- ARM Vs. RISC Vs. ...
--- HW Attacks / Tempering

--- Syscall with ASM on Linux 

--- LeetCode: N often small 


o- Video drehen und Einsprechen: Montag
o- Lernen / Texten / Schneiden : Abends (oder wann Zeit ist)


==== Learning in Paralell 
- Rust Book
(Unsafe code with raw pointers, WebServer Task of RUST book, 
rustlings.org,
Common Project Case like videos:
- errors, utils/support, modules, Construct/Setter/Builder, Ext. Trait && Wrapper Trait, Examples & Tests, Compiling README + Documentstion
)
- RISC-V Book (Run ASM, C, RUST with blinkikg LED and debugging)
- DAILY Algo.Monster in Rust | C
- RISC-V + RUST: Internet-Radio Stream, Output, intergrierbar ins Smart Home via Zigbee. Inkl. Leiterplatine & 3D Druck Schablone. Alles in Github.
- RISC-V + RUST: USB-Keyboard Switcher.
Gets SD-Card with Mapping. Maps keys to those (multiple) keys. Led (Startup, Ready, Err-SD, PAUSED), ON / OFF button. Good for Gaming Shortcuts or to Prank Collegues.
Showcase with Logicanalyser or Oszi.
- RISC-V OR ARM : Life Speech Frequenz modifier. Plug in your Usb Microfon / Headset and everythinf is bypassed to output, but speech is modified. 
---> Maybe later with AI to translate on fly.
- RUST Liegestützapp
- Yocto, Zephir
